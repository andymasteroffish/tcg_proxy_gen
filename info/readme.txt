TCG Proxy Generator by Andy Wallace

I had a way less user friendly version of this program that I used to test my own card games and to print proxies for MTG cards that were too valuable to actually play with. It seemed useful so I decided to rework it into something other people could easily use. Hopefully it is helpful to you

Issues opening the application:

On windows, if you get “Windows protected your PC” when opening the application, click “more info” and then “Run Anyway.”

On Mac, if you get a message saying it can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, click OK. Right click (or command click) the app and select Open. This time when the unidentified developer window pops up, click open.

Using:

Drag and drop card images or folders of images into the app to make your sheets. Folders are opened recursively, so any folder inside a folder you drag in will also be searched for images.

Images must have the extension “.jpg” “.jpeg” “.png” or “.gif”

Clicking print will export a multipage pdf of your images.

Higher resolution source images result in better looking proxies.

—————

No images are supplied with this program. You will have to find or create them yourself.

I find this is a good site for high-res MTG images: http://magiccards.info/

Because images can be different sizes, the spacing turned into less of an exact science. I set the defaults to be what worked for me, but you may want to print a single page first to make sure the cards are the right size for you.

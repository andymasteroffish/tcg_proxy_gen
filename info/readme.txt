This tool lets you drag in images or folders of images and export multi-page, ready-to-print PDFs that can be cut up and slipped into card sleeves.

This is a more user-friendly version of my Booster Pack Generator which I used to test my own games. That tool is available here: andymakes.itch.io/booster-pack-generator

Issues opening the application:

On Windows, if you get “Windows protected your PC” when opening the application, click “more info” and then “Run Anyway.”

On Mac, if you get a message saying it can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer, click OK. Right click (or command-click) the app and select Open. This time when the unidentified developer window pops up, click open.

Using:

Drag and drop card images or folders of images into the app to make your sheets. Folders are opened recursively, so any folder inside a folder you drag in will also be searched for images.

Images must have the extension “.jpg” “.jpeg” “.png” or “.gif”

Clicking print will export a multipage pdf of your images.

Higher resolution source images result in better looking proxies.

No images are supplied with this program. You will have to find or create them yourself.

I find this is a good site for high-res MTG images: http://magiccards.info/

Because images can be different sizes, the spacing turned into less of an exact science. I set the defaults to what worked for me, but you may want to print a single page first to make sure the cards are the right size for you.

This tool is free. You can share it, although I’d like it if you kept this readme with it.
